The project uses pyenv and pytest.  It also demonstrates how to generate egg files.

Here is a link to a blog post that explains how this application was built.

**Upgrade python**

    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python

    mkdir ./dist
    cp ./src/main.py ../dist/
    cd ./src && zip -x main.py -r ../dist/wordcount .

    source venv/bin/activate





**To run this PySpark Streaming application, execute the following command from your $SPARK_HOME folder:**

    ./bin/spark-submit wordcount.py localhost 9999

**In terms of how you time this, you should:**

    First start with nc -lk 9999.
  
 

**Then, start typing your events, for example:**

For the first second, type
